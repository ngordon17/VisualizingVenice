Does the digital age demand a re-evaluation of traditional research methodologies? What can technology do for the humanities? Can it be a tool for answering research questions related to art and urban history? The Visualizing Venice project interrogates the limitations of methodologies, based on the static image and written word, and explores technology not only as a means of representing research but as a research tool in itself.

Visualizing Venice interrogates growth and change in the city of Venice. Our team combines onsite and archival research in Venice with web tools and visualization technologies to create a mobile app, website, and database designed to help visitors to Venice (both physical and virtual) better understand how centuries of change and development produced the city that we experience today.

Our team consists of faculty and students from Duke University, the Università IUAV di Venezia, the Università degli Studi di Padova, and Nesting Scrl. (click here: http://visualizingvenice.org/people/ for a list of individual participants). As educators, we are committed to training our undergraduate and graduate students not only in historical research, but also in the technologies that will shape the future of our discipline. We also stress the importance of international collaboration, and regularly organize training seminars and workshops in Venice and in the United States.
