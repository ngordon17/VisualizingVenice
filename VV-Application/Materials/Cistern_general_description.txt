What does one drink in a city built on salt water?  As Venice could not dig wells to provide its inhabitants with fresh water, the city was filled with cisterns used to store rainwater.  Found in nearly every campo and courtyard in Venice, cisterns collected and filtered water via a sophisticated system of pipes leading from rooftops and pavements.  While private cisterns were found in the palazzi of wealthy families, those in campisuch as S.S. Giovanni e Paolo were public and contributed to the vibrant dynamic of the urban space.
