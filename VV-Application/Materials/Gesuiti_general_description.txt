The history of the insula of S.S. Giovanni e Paolo is a rich cross-section of the history of Venice itself. Since the 13th century, this area on Venice’s northern shore has been the site of important civic and religious institutions, such as the Domenican basilica of S. S. Giovanni e Paolo, the Scuola Grande di San Marco, and the city’s hospital. It is also a site of a large-scale land reclamation project, the Fondamente Nuove.

But what has changed since the 13th century? How did the form of the insula – built, like the rest of Venice, on wooden pylons driven into marshy wetlands – morph and grow through the centuries? What led to the concentration of powerful institutions and organizations in this area? This app allows us to explore and visualize the complex history of this urban space.
